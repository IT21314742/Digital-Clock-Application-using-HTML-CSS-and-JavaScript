# Digital Clock Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Description
This is a digital clock application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock shows the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and updates every second in real-time. It is designed to be responsive, adjusting seamlessly to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Features
- **Real-time Clock**: Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock adapts to different screen sizes, working well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **12-hour / 24-hour Format**: Optionally, you can modify the JavaScript to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats (if this feature is included in your app).

## Usage
- Once the application is opened in a browser, it will automatically display the current time and update every second.
- The JavaScript function setInterval() ensures the time is updated dynamically.

## Code Structure
- HTML: Provides the basic structure of the page.
- CSS: Styles the clock interface and ensures responsiveness.
- JavaScript: Retrieves the current time from the user's system and updates the display every second.
